#Rebmem Engineering Media Player Prototype

As part of the Rebmem Engineering Team, I have produced an interface which will allow for the sale of the device as a portable music player.
The current project allows for continous improvement.

#Features:

As a user, so that I can allow music playback,
I want to be able to stop/start a song by pressing a button.

As a user, so that I can keep listening to the song and save power even if I don't interact with the device over 30 second period,
I want to allow music playback when the device becomes idle.

As a user, so that I have the app choose a random song for me,
I want to be able to press shuffle.

As a user, so that I can play a specific song,
I want to be able to search for a specific song either by artist or song name.

As a user, so that I can see the information on the tracks available,
I want to be able to see display options by song track or album.

As a user, so that I can organise my songs,
I want to be able to create a song play list.

As a user, so that I can choose to play either a previous or next song,
I want to be able to control the playback by either going back to the previous or next song.


As a developer, so that my app has minimal basic user interface,
I want to use CSS to style to my media player.

As a developer, so that I test drive my development,
I want to implement testing to achieve 100% test coverage.

## Tech Stack: MEVN Stack: MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node

Vue & Nuxt to build the front end of the media player.

Node was used to build the server side.

CSS to style the media player.

HTML to structure the page.

Express was used to write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

MongoDB for creating a database.

## Installation

First, clone this repository. Then:

 # Install dependencies
$ npm run install

# to install server side & nodemon
 $ node index.js nodemon index.js

# To get started:

        cd musicapp
        npm run dev

# To build & start for production:

        cd musicapp
        npm run build
        npm run start

# To test:

        cd musicapp
        npm run test

The project contains a folder with audio video which can be used to test the functionality of the app by uploading them to the manager and deleting them at user's preference.
